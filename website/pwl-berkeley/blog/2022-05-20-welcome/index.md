Hello, welcome. I just started building this website, so some of the content are empty/the content defaults, please excuse my hectic schedule, I'm trying to get to eveything as soon as I can. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you feel like PWL Berkeley would be something you would be interested in contributing.

In the meantime enjoy this puzzle and a photo of our campus:

- In a town there are n people and k clubs. Each club has an odd number of members and any two clubs have an even number of common members. Prove that k â‰¤ n.
